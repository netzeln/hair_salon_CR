# _Hair Salon_

#### _Managment Site for a Hair Salon, 2016-02-26_

#### By _**Nic Netzel (with thanks to this weeks' pair-programming partners (which was mostly Jared Beckler))**_

## Description

_This app allows the user to enter the names of Stylists at a Hair Salon as well as the Clients that see each Stylist.  Stylists names can be modified, or a Stylist (or the whole staff) can be fired. Clients' names can be modified, and their Stylist of Choice can be adjusted, or a Client (or whole list of clients) can be dropped. Clients do not disappear when a Stylist is Fired, but they do become unattached from that stylist and can be reassigned. C_

## Setup/Installation Requirements
